    "title": "Meta Tracks Employee AI Use, Gamifies Adoption 🎯",
    "full": "Meta has begun actively monitoring how much its employees use AI tools internally, and turned it into a gamified system dubbed 'Level Up'. Employees earn badges as they hit AI usage milestones using their internal chatbot, MetaMate. This initiative aims to boost AI adoption across teams and integrate AI deeper into daily workflows.\n\n💡 Example: A software engineer using Meta’s AI code assistant more consistently could unlock productivity badges and gain internal recognition.\n\n⚠️ Note: This also sparks debate about surveillance and privacy in workplaces."

    "title": "California Signs AI Safety Disclosure Law 🏛️",
    "full": "Governor Gavin Newsom of California signed a landmark law mandating that major AI companies publicly disclose safety protocols and report incidents within 15 days. It aims to regulate powerful AI models to prevent misuse in areas such as infrastructure sabotage or bioweapon development. Violations could cost companies up to $1 million. 0\n\n💡 Example: AI firms crossing a computational threshold must document how they mitigate risks and make those documents public.\n\n⚠️ Pro Tip: AI startups should begin building transparency & safety logs now, before regulations catch up."

    "title": "Meta to Use Chatbot Conversations for Ad Targeting 📢",
    "full": "Meta plans to begin using conversations from its AI chatbot to personalize ads on Facebook and Instagram. Starting December 2025, these conversations will feed into ad targeting, with exceptions for sensitive topics. Users in EU, UK, South Korea will be exempt initially. 5\n\n💡 Example: You chat with Meta’s AI assistant about hiking boots, then see more boot ads in your feed.\n\n⚠️ Concern: Privacy and consent become critical — users may push back on how personal chats are monetized."
