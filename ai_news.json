    "title": "Adobe Unveils AI Creative Tools for Everyone 🎨",
    "full": "At Adobe MAX 2025, Adobe introduced major updates across its tools including Adobe Firefly, Creative Cloud and GenStudio. New features allow creators to generate full videos, use audio & video generative workflows, and operate conversational AI assistants inside the creative suite. \n\n💡 Example: A designer types “Create a 30-second brand promo with upbeat music and product shots” and Firefly automates most of it with just a few tweaks. \n\n✨ Why it matters: These innovations lower the barrier for video & audio content creation — you don’t need deep technical skills to produce high-quality assets."

    "full": "Google’s AI Mode in Search now supports advanced visual queries where users can upload an image or take a live photo, ask a question, and get rich results combining vision + voice + text. This update was rolled out globally this week. \n\n💡 Example: You upload a picture of an antique vase and ask “What era is this from and where can I buy similar in brown?” — you’ll get era info + shopping results instantly. \n\n⚡ Why it matters: Search is moving from typing to talking + seeing — and that shift changes how we interact with info."

    "title": "MIT Warns Generative AI’s Climate Impact 🌍",
    "full": "MIT researchers released findings showing that large-scale generative AI training could significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions unless energy efficiency and sustainable compute infrastructure are prioritized. They urge model makers and data centres to adopt renewable power and efficient design. \n\n💡 Example: Training a major language model in a carbon-intensive grid may emit as much CO₂ as hundreds of cars in a year — that impact can be halved by switching to model pruning and cleaner energy. \n\n⚠️ Why it matters: As AI usage grows, its environmental cost becomes a part of the story — responsible AI isn't just about bias, but also power."

    "title": "OpenAI & AMD Expand Compute Deal 🧠",
    "full": "OpenAI and AMD are deepening their collaboration by planning a multi-year rollout of AI-specific chips starting in 2026, aiming for multi-gigawatt scale deployments of AMD’s Instinct MI450 hardware. The agreement is a strategic move to meet exponential demand for compute in generative AI. \n\n💡 Example: The first phase will deploy around 1 gigawatt of AI compute, enabling faster model updates and reduced latency for AI services. \n\n✨ Why it matters: The hardware race is heating up — for AI apps, the backend infrastructure choices now matter just as much as algorithms."
